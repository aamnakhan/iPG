var tips = [
	'Try to have quick and concise answers.',
	'Try to answer in 2 to 3 sentences.',
	'Answer like you would in a conversation, this is not a presentation.',
	'When talking to PG and the other YC partners, be substantive, and get straight to the point.',
	'DO NOT BEAT AROUND THE BUSH. Do not hem and haw. "Uhm"s and "uh"s don&#39;t lend an aura of intelligence.',
	'Use precise and concise language. You aren&#39;t pitching a VC that will ask you what your "secret sauce" is.',
	'He talks quickly, and so do the other YC partners. Try to match their tempo (as you should when talking to anyone).'
